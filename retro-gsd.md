# GSD Stage 5: RETRO - Process Improvement

<!-- Type: retro-gsd | Category: GSD | Full: retro-gsd -->

Analyze the session to identify gaps in global cursor rules and propose improvements.

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW CONTEXT

**You are here**: SPEC ✅ → PLAN ✅ → BUILD ✅ → VERIFY ✅ → **RETRO** ← YOU ARE HERE (FINAL STAGE)

**What happens now**: I'll analyze this entire GSD session to improve future workflows:
- What went well vs poorly
- Mistakes made and how to prevent them
- Missing patterns/rules that should be documented
- Process improvements for `.cursor/rules/`

**What you do next**: 
1. Review the retrospective findings
2. Approve any proposed rule updates
3. Close the ticket - you're done! 🎉

**Expected output**: 
- Section 11 added to `.cursor/plans/[TICKET-ID].md`
- Proposed updates to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (if needed)
- Documented learnings for future reference

**This closes the GSD cycle** - the workflow is complete after this stage.

## Goal

Learn from this session to improve future AI agent performance.

## Procedure

### 1. Load Session Context

**Locate Plan**:
```bash
git branch --show-current  # Extract ticket ID
```

**Read Entire Context File**: `.cursor/plans/[TICKET-ID].md`
- Section 1-6: SPEC (research, findings, API contracts, risks, success criteria)
- Section 7: PLAN (implementation plan)
- Section 8: BUILD PROTOTYPE LOG (execution notes, decisions)
- Section 9: BUILD QUALITY LOG (tests, linting, codacy fixes)
- Section 10: VERIFICATION (quality checks, issues found/fixed)

**Review Chat History**:
- What questions did the AI ask?
- What mistakes were made?
- What patterns were reinforced or violated?
- What context did the user provide that helped?

### 2. Pre-Flight Checklist

**MANDATORY: Read ALL current cursor rules**:
```bash
ls .cursor/rules/*.mdc
```

Understand the current state before proposing changes.

### 3. Session Analysis

Look for critical moments:

**Questions That Shouldn't Have Been Asked**:
- Information that *should* have been in a rule
- Patterns that exist in the codebase but aren't documented
- Project-specific conventions not captured

**Mistakes That Were Corrected**:
- AI made wrong assumptions about architecture
- AI violated a pattern that wasn't in rules
- User corrected an approach

**Patterns Reinforced**:
- Successful patterns used during implementation
- Shortcuts or utilities that worked well
- Testing approaches that were effective

**User-Provided Context**:
- Knowledge user shared that would help future sessions
- Edge cases or gotchas user warned about
- Business logic explanations

**Quality Issues**:
- Recurring Codacy issues (e.g., same category across files)
- Lint patterns that appeared multiple times
- Test patterns that needed explanation

### 4. Gap Analysis

Read all current rules and identify **missing** knowledge:

**Categories to Consider**:

**Patterns**:
- Component structure (file organization, prop patterns)
- Hook usage (custom hooks, React Query patterns)
- State management (how state flows through the app)
- Error handling (how errors are caught and displayed)
- Loading states (patterns for async operations)

**Conventions**:
- Naming (variables, functions, files, directories)
- Imports (path aliases, ordering, grouping)
- File organization (where things live, co-location)
- Type definitions (where types live, naming conventions)

**Gotchas**:
- Legacy quirks (old code that can't be changed yet)
- Known issues (workarounds for bugs)
- Performance concerns (patterns to avoid)
- Browser compatibility (IE11, Safari specifics)

**API Patterns** (for wavebid-a2o):
- How frontend types are generated from backend
- Common transformations between API and UI
- Authentication patterns
- Error response handling

**Testing**:
- Test file naming and location
- Test utilities and helpers
- Mocking patterns
- Assertion styles

**Monorepo-Specific**:
- When to use shared packages
- How to add dependencies
- Import patterns for cross-package references

### 5. Proposal Generation

For each gap, create a proposal:

```markdown
### Proposed Rule Change #[N]

**Action**: `CREATE` | `UPDATE` | `DELETE`
**File**: `.cursor/rules/[filename].mdc`

**Content to Add/Change**:
```
[The actual markdown content]
```

**Reason**: [Why this is needed based on this session]

**Evidence from Session**:
- [Specific example from SPEC/PLAN/BUILD/VERIFY]
- [What would have been different with this rule]

**Impact**:
- Future sessions will: [benefit]
- Reduces need for: [clarifying questions / user corrections]
```

### 6. Prioritization

Rank proposals by impact:

**High Priority** (Critical for next session):
- Prevents mistakes that happened this session
- Documents patterns used multiple times
- Captures business logic essential for this feature area

**Medium Priority** (Nice to have):
- Improves efficiency (fewer questions)
- Clarifies ambiguous conventions
- Documents edge cases

**Low Priority** (Optional polish):
- Style preferences
- Minor optimizations
- Rare edge cases

**GSD Workflow Complete for [TICKET-ID]** 🎉

Full session context preserved in: `.cursor/plans/[TICKET-ID].md`
```

## Important Notes

- **Evidence-Based**: Only propose rules based on concrete session evidence
- **Specific**: Rules should be actionable, not vague
- **Maintainable**: Keep rules focused and organized by category
- **User Approval**: NEVER apply rule changes without user permission
- **Impact Focus**: Prioritize proposals that prevent mistakes/questions
- **Context Preservation**: The plan file is the source of truth for analysis

## Categories for Rule Files

Suggested organization:

- `component-patterns.mdc` - Component structure, props, composition
- `hook-patterns.mdc` - Custom hooks, React Query usage
- `testing-patterns.mdc` - Test structure, mocking, assertions
- `api-integration.mdc` - Frontend/backend contracts, transformations
- `monorepo-conventions.mdc` - Cross-package patterns
- `gotchas-[feature].mdc` - Feature-specific quirks and workarounds
- `naming-conventions.mdc` - File, variable, function naming
- `import-patterns.mdc` - Import ordering, aliases, grouping

## Exit Conditions

- ✅ **Complete**: Rules updated, improvements documented
- ⏭️ **Skipped**: User chooses not to update rules (session still valuable)
- 🔄 **Revised**: User requests changes to proposals before applying
